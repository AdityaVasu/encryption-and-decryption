## Introduction

This application provides a command-line interface to generate RSA keys, encrypt data using RSA, decrypt data using RSA, encrypt data using AES, and decrypt data using AES.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pair (public key and private key).
- Encrypt data using RSA with the public key.
- Decrypt data using RSA with the private key.
- Encrypt data using AES with a symmetric key and initialization vector (IV).
- Decrypt data using AES with the symmetric key and initialization vector (IV).
- Copy encrypted message to the clipboard for easy sharing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- cryptography library (version 3.4.7 or above)
